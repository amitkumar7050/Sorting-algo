# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer



Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application built with React that visually demonstrates classic sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. The app provides a user-friendly interface with customizable array size, sorting speed, and controls for enhanced user experience.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: 
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Customizable Options**:
  - Adjust array size dynamically.
  - Control the sorting speed using a slider.
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Generate a new random array.
  - Select a sorting algorithm.
  - Start and observe the sorting process step by step.
- **Responsive Design**: 
  - Works seamlessly on different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Visuals**:
  - Real-time color changes and animations to visualize sorting stages.
